      paragraphs:
        bicycle_project_paragraph: Community bicycle projects do many different things.
          Some use bicycles to change society, the economy, or the environment. Some
          have community bike shops. Some promote bicycle use and making their communities
          into places where riding is easier, more inclusive, safer, and more fun.
          The list below uses the criteria found in the old Bicycle Organization Organization
          Project for what constitutes a community bike shop. The bike project need
          not meet all these criteria. Rather, it is a general list of qualities which
          are common among many bicycle projects.
        Who_is_Invited: You don’t have to be an expert or belong to a huge group,
          you just need to be willing to share what you know about organization, mechanics,

          in your community.
        Types_of_Workshops: Workshops are organized and run by attendees. They can
          be about anything that might concern community bicycle projects and can

          groups, and bicycle rides. If you would like to host your own workshop,
          you can enter details after registering. What ends up in the final schedule
          and when they happen are decided on by the conference hosts.
        Amenities: Traditionally conference hosts arrange shared accommodations, one
          to two meals a day, and bicycles will be available for registered attendees.
          However you should check the conference details on the current conference.
          More information on how you can arrange your own accommodation and recommended
          places to visit should also be provided to you by the hosts on the conference
          page or upon arrival.

          a tall bike, building 3-speed hubs out of fishing tackle and old socks,
          etc,) anti-oppression (safe spaces, women’s workshops, etc,) and recreational
          (touring tips, yoga for cyclists, etc.) This year we would like to try a
          panel, a forum, or other types of settings that you think might facilitate
          learning – be inventive, let us know what you want to see!'
        Workshops: Do you have an exciting skill to share with us?  Want to chat about
          creating safe community spaces?  Want to make sure we fit a good bike ride
          into the weekend?  Propose a workshop!  Don’t worry if you’re not an expert,
          we want to hear about everyone’s experience within the many configurations
          of community shops we’re coming from.
